# Welcome to the vita troubleshooting guide!

Have a problem with your Vita? Don't know what you did wrong and didn't get a clear answer?
Don't worry: this guide will help you recover from whatever issue you're facing.

Anyone can contribute to this project. You can do this by opening an issue to share information,
ask something about a subject, or even by asking for help. I will merge the solution into the guide.

The changes will be merged using gitbook and I will use it for making the guide. It provides a clear
interface and will be user-friendly. It is used in a lot of hacks domains, like for example hackintoshing.
